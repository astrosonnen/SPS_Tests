# Tests on stellar population synthesis modeling

## Questions

- Are stellar ages of massive quiescent galaxies derived from SPS modeling consistent with our understanding of their star formation history?
- Can we make good use of spectral line measurements to improve the accuracy of SPS models?
- Detailed studies of the stellar populations of massive galaxies show trends between: age and velocity dispersion, mass and metallicity. Can these trends be seen in SED fitting-based SPS models? If not, are stellar masses biased? By how much? Is this a problem for e.g. studies of scaling relations between quantities at fixed stellar mass (e.g. halo mass vs. size at fixed stellar mass)?
- At fixed stellar mass, do age-sensitive absorption line indices (Hdelta, D4000) correlate with velocity dispersion? Does the correlation hold if the stellar masses and ages are derived self-consistently?
